 * Description : In several Game Zone assignments earlier in this book, you created games similar to Hangman in which the user guesses a secret phrase by
        selecting a series of letters. These versions had limited appeal because each contained only a few possible phrases to guess; after playing the
        games a few times, the user would have memorized all the phrases. Now create a version in which any number of secret phrases can be saved to a 
        file before the game is played. Use a text editor such as Notepad to type any number of phrases into a file, one per line. Save the file as 
        Phrases.txt. Then, create a game that randomly selects a phrase from the file and allows a user to guess the phrase letter by letter.
