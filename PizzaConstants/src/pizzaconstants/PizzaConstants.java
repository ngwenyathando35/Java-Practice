 * Description : Demonstrating the creation of interfaces to store related constants. The purpose in creating an
        interface containing constants is to provide a set of data that a number of classes can use without 
        having to redeclare the values. In this program, the interface class provides a number of constants for 
        a pizzeria. Any class written for the pizzeria can implement this interface and use the permanent 
        values. Works as intended. */
