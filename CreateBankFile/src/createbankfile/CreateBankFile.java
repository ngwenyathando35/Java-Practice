 * Description : The Rochester Bank maintains customer records in a random access file. This program creates 10,000 blank records and then allows the 
        user to enter customer account information, including an account number that is 9999 or less, a last name, and a balance. A new record is 
        inserted into a data file at a location that is equal to the account number. The program assumes that the user will not enter invalid account 
        numbers. It the forces each name to eight characters, padding it with spaces.
