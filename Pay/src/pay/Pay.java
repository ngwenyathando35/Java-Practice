 * Description : Write an interactive Java payroll application that calculates the net pay for a factory worker 
    The program prompts the user for skill level and hours worked, as well as appropriate insurance and 
    retirement options for the employeeâ€™s skill level category. The application displays: 
(1) the hours worked, 
(2) the hourly pay rate, 
(3) the regular pay for 40 hours, 
(4) the overtime pay, 
(5) the total of regular and overtime pay, and 
(6) the total itemized deductions. If the deductions exceed the gross pay, display an error message; otherwise, calculate and display 
(7) the net pay after all the deductions have been subtracted from the gross.
