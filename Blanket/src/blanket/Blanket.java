 * Description : This class has fields for a blanketâ€™s size, color, material, and price. It includes a 
        constructor that sets default values for the fields as Twin, white,cotton, and R527,7. It has a set 
        method for each of the first three fields. The method that sets size adds R179.5 to the base price for a
        double blanket, R439.75 for a queen blanket, and R703.6 for a king. The method that sets the material 
        adds R351.8 to the price for wool and R719.55 to the price for cashmere. In other words, the price for a
        king-sized cashmere blanket is R2022,85. Whenever the size or material is invalid, it resets the blanket
        to the default values. It also has a toString() method that returns a description of the blanket.
