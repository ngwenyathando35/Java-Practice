 * Description : Thando's Construction Loan Company makes loans of up to R1_715_000 for construction projects. 
        There are two categories of Loansâ€”those to businesses and those to individual applicants. This an 
        abstract class that implements the LoanConstants interface. A Loan includes a loan number, customer last 
        name, amount of loan, interest rate, and term. The constructor requires data for each of the fields 
        except interest rate. It does not allow loan amounts over R1_715_000. It forces the loan term that is 
        not one of the three defined in the LoanConstants class to a short-term, 1-year loan. It has a 
        toString() method that displays all the loan data.
