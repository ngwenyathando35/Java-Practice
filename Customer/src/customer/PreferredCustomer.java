 * Description : Demonstrating Accessing superclass methods from the child 
   In the PreferredCustomer display() method, we want to display all three fields - idNumber, balanceOwed, and 
    discountRate. Because two-thirds of the code to accomplish the display has already been written for the 
    Customer class, it is convenient to have the PreferredCustomer display() method use its parentâ€™s version of 
    the display() method before displaying its own discount rate. Works as intended*/
package customer;
public class PreferredCustomer extends Customer
{
    double discountRate;
    public PreferredCustomer(int id, double bal, double rate)
    {
        super(id, bal);
        discountRate = rate;
    }
    @Override
    public void display()
    {
        super.display();
        System.out.println("Discount rate is " + discountRate);
    }
}
