 * Description : Demonstrating Using a Layout Manager: This program shows the JFrameâ€™s layout manager has been set so that multiple components are 
        visible. Because a FlowLayout is used, the two JLabels appear side by side. If there were more JLabels or other components, they would continue
        to be placed side by side across the JFrame until there was no more room. Then, the additional components would be placed in a new row beneath 
        the first row of components. Works as intended*/
