 * Description : This is a parent Person class that contains a first name, last name, street address, zip code, 
        and phone number. The class also includes a method that sets each data field, using a series of dialog 
        boxes and a display method that displays all of a Personâ€™s information on a single line at the command 
        line on the screen. Works as intended.
