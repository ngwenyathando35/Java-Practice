 * Description : This is a child class of PhoneCall named IncomingPhoneCall. It has a constructor that passes 
        its phone number parameter to its parentâ€™s constructor and sets the price of the call to 0.02. The 
        method that displays the phone call information displays the phone number, the rate, and the price of 
        the call (which is the same as the rate).
